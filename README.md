# blackjack
This is my blackjack game. I will add additional functionality as my skill set improves. 
The purpose is to learn and use various Python skills to build a functional blackjack game. I plan on using loops to automate as many tasks as possible. The goal will be to refine my code as much as possible. Stage 1 will be complete when the dealer and player flows are correct. Stage 2 will be complete when I can add multiple players and have 4 decks in the shoe. Stage 3 will be complete when there is a user interface.
